# Short Story

The suspicious 90%  turnout in Wisconsin (compared to the usual 60%-70%) is being calculated as a percentage of the registered voters, not of voting age population as it usually is. Using the usual method we get ~72%.

# Long Story

A more extreme version of the claim, namely that "Wisconsin had more votes than registered voters" was discussed on [politifact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/tweets/no-wisconsin-doesnt-have-more-ballots-cast-registe/) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104210736/https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/tweets/no-wisconsin-doesnt-have-more-ballots-cast-registe/)) and rated "Pants on Fire" false.

They link a NYT [article/archive](https://archive.is/fIHLp#selection-2951.0-2951.9) claiming there were 3,296,836	reported votes at 12:40 p.m. E.T. Nov 5th, and  Wisconsin Electoral Commission [page](https://elections.wi.gov/node/7220) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104233338/https://elections.wi.gov/node/7220)) stating there were 3,684,726 people registered to vote. This puts the Wisconsin voter turnout at ~89.5% (as of 12:40).

How out of the ordinary is this? According, again, to the Wisconsin Electoral Commission's [turnout page](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104192340/https://elections.wi.gov/elections-voting/statistics/turnout) ([archive](https://archive.org/details/voter-turnout-partisan-non-partisan-through-august-2020)), the turnouts for the previous presidential elections were:

| Year | Turnout|
|------|:------:|
| 2016 | 67.34% |
| 2012 | 70.14% |
| 2008 | 69.20% |
| 2004 | 73.24% |
| 2000 | 67.01% |
| 1996 | 58.00% |
| 1992 | 68.99% |
| 1988 | 61.00% |
| 1984 | 63.43% |
| 1980 | 67.35% |
| 1976 | 66.38% |
| 1972 | 62.45% |
| 1968 | 65.98% |
| 1964 | 68.68% |
| 1960 | 72.99% |
| 1956 | 67.15% |
| 1952 | 71.56% |
| 1948 | 57.71% |

These numbers make 89.5% suspicious. However, they are calculated as a percentage of the total voting population, which is estimated to be 4,536,293 this year ([per the WEC](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104192340/https://elections.wi.gov/elections-voting/statistics/turnout)), giving a turnout of 72.7%. A near record turnout, but not nearly so suspicious.
