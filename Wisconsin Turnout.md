A more extreme version of the claim, namely that "Wisconsin had more votes than registered voters" was discussed on [politifact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/tweets/no-wisconsin-doesnt-have-more-ballots-cast-registe/) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104210736/https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/tweets/no-wisconsin-doesnt-have-more-ballots-cast-registe/)) and rated "Pants on Fire" false.

They link a NYT [article/archive](https://archive.is/fIHLp#selection-2951.0-2951.9) claiming there were 3,296,836	reported votes at 12:40 p.m. E.T. Nov 5th, and  Wisconsin Electoral Commission [page](https://elections.wi.gov/node/7220) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104233338/https://elections.wi.gov/node/7220)) stating there were 3,684,726 people registered to vote. This puts the Wisconsin voter turnout at ~89.5% (as of 12:40).
