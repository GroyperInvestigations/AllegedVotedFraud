# AllegedVotedFraud

- Wisconsin's voter turnout is unreasonably high and is likely inflated by false ballots, [likely false](https://github.com/GroyperInvestigations/AllegedVotedFraud/blob/main/Wisconsin%20Turnout.md), possible, needs requires snapshots from before the counting halt
- Atlanta vote count was falsely delayed by a broken pipe, which allowed time to falsify votes
- Green Bay vote count being delayed due to lack of ink was a false pretext to falsify votes
- Joe Biden received a sudden influx of 138,339 votes in Michigan while Donald Trump received none, likely false
- Ballots were dumped in Michigan
